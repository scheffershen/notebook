## What is SCORM?

SCORM (which stands for Sharable Content Object Reference Model), was originally developed in 1999.  Back then, elearning content could only be used on one system because different technologies didn’t have a way of speak to one another to pass across information reliably. So, a new protocol was established for tracking learning activity… SCORM.

SCORM 2004 allows you to track completion rates, pass/fail, single scores and time spent – but that’s about as far as it goes.

But, today learning happens everywhere – and SCORM doesn’t offer a way to capture this information.

## What is xAPI?

Since it’s release in April 2013, the Experience API (also known as xAPI or Tin-Can) has knocked SCORM off its long established perch.

Like SCORM, xAPI is a protocol for tracking learning related activity. The key difference is that xAPI allows you to track learning in almost any context, not just in the LMS.

xAPI enables the recording, tracking, personalizing and improving of learning activities, both on and offline.

Using xAPI you could pull together data from a range of different sources into your LRS (Learning record store), for example:
