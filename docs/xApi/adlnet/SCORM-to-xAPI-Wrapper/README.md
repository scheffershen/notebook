SCORM-to-xAPI-Wrapper
=====================

https://github.com/adlnet/SCORM-to-xAPI-Wrapper

This project contains a modified *SCORM Version 1.2 APIWrapper.js* file, a modified *SCORM 2004 APIWrapper.js* file and a new *SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js* file that handles automated conversion of *SCORM Data Model elements* to *associated xAPI statements*.  This wrapper implements the SCORM Data Model conversion as defined in the [Experience API SCORM Profile](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-SCORM-Profile).  This document is in draft form.  Changes will be made to this wrapper to coincide with changes to the *xAPI SCORM Profile*.

For detailed technical information on xAPI, [read the Experience API Spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md)

## SCORM2004/APIWrapper.js

Javascript *SCORM 2004 API* wrapper with new *xAPI object* (Implemented in *SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js*).  
This javascript file is typically used in SCORM 2004 courses.  If the ADL-provided *ADLWrapper.js* file is used in your SCORM courses, it can be replaced with this file.

Note: The updated *APIWrapper.js* file does not stand-alone and MUST be  used with the *SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js* file.

## SCORM1.2/APIWrapper.js

Javascript *SCORM 1.2 API* wrapper with new xAPI object (Implemented in *SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js*).  
This javascript file is typically used in SCORM 1.2 courses.  If the ADL-provided *ADLWrapper.js* file is used in your SCORM courses, it can be replaced with this file.

Note: The updated *APIWrapper.js* file does not stand-alone and MUST be  used with the *SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js* file.

## SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js

JavaScript file that implements an *"xapi" object* that abstracts implementation details of the *xAPI SCORM Profile*.  This object is integrated into the *APIWrapper.js* file in order to automatically convert *SCORM Run-Time communication* to *associated xAPI statements*.

This version of the wrapper supports SCORM 2004 and SCORM 1.2.

### Dependencies == xapiwrapper.min.js

The *SCORM-to-xAPI-Wrapper* relies on external dependencies to perform some actions. Make sure you download the minified [xAPI Wrapper](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper/blob/master/dist/xapiwrapper.min.js) to be included in your legacy SCORM courses.  Information on integration of this file is included in the Configuration section below.

### Configuration

To update your *SCORM 2004* courses to additionally *track xAPI statements* replace the appropriate *APIWrapper.js* file (1.2 or 2004 version depending on your SCORM version) with the SCORM-to-xAPI-Wrapper and include two new files:  

* the standard *xapiwrapper.min.js* file listed in the dependency above
* the new *SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js* file included in this projecct

Next, add the following code in the &lt;head&gt; sections of each *SCO* in your course.  SCO launch files can be identified by looking at the *imsmanifest.xml* file at the root of the SCORM package.  Resource elements with *adlcp:scormtype* set to "sco" should contain the complete list of SCOs in the course.  Each SCO will be an 'activity' tracked by *xAPI statements*.  Paste the following code before the *script* tag that references the *APIWrapper.js* file.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  var activity = document.location.protocol + "//" + document.location.host + document.location.pathname;
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../Shared/JavaScript/xapiwrapper.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../Shared/JavaScript/SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js"></script>
```

Notes:

* Be sure that the path in the src attribute above points to the location of the minified *xapiwrapper.min.js* and *SCORMToXAPIFunctions.js* file.  This location assumes that one directory up from the SCO location, that there is a Shared/JavaScript directory with your JavaScript files.
* *Activity IDs* will be automatically generated based on the *URL of the SCO*.  This may be LMS-dependent, so it is also possible to manually configure your activity URIs by changing a line of javascript code in each SCO.  This will also ensure that your activity IRIs do not change when you import a new copy of the course or include the same course in an additional LMS.  To optionally configure your activity URI's make the following update:

```js
var activity = <manually configured URI goes here>;
// ex. var activity = "http://adlnet.gov/courses/example/module1"
```

Finally, several configuration values must be set in the updated *APIWrapper.js* file (init method).  Instructions are also included in the header at the top of the JavaScript file. Near the top of the file, configure the following lines of code:

```js
 var config = {
    lrs:{
       endpoint:"https://lrs.adlnet.gov/xapi/",
       user:"<lrs user>",
       password:"<lrs password>"
    },
    courseId:"<course identifier/uri>",
    lmsHomePage:"<lms homepage>"
 };
```

### Limitations

Currently, the SCORM to xAPI Wrapper handles a subset of SCORM *Run-Time behaviors* and *data model elements*.  This list will be expanded over time.  Currently, the wrapper supports:

The following data model elements or behaviors result in associated xAPI statements:

**Core SCO Data**

* cmi.score.scaled
* cmi.success_status
* cmi.completion_status
* cmi.exit

**Interactions Data**

* cmi.interactions.n.id
* cmi.interactions.n.type
* cmi.interactions.n.description
* cmi.interactions.n.learner_response

**Behaviors**

* SCO Initialize
* SCO Terminates
* SCO Resumes
* SCO Suspends

The following data is stored as either profile or state information

**Activity Profile**  

*Identified by:*
* Activity IRI
* Profile ID - https://w3id.org/xapi/scorm/activity-profile

*Data:*

* completion_threshold (value of cmi.completion_threshold data)
* launch_data (value of cmi.launch_data)
* max_time_allowed (value of cmi.max_time_allowed)
* scaled_passing_score (value of cmi.scaled_passing_score)
* time_limit_action (value of cmi.time_limit_action)

**Activity State**

*Identified by:*

* Activity IRI
* Actor
* State ID = https://w3id.org/xapi/scorm/activity-state

*Data:*
* attempts (Ordered list of attempt IRIs found as context in statements)

**Attempt State**

*Identified by:*

* Attempt IRI (context activity)
* Actor
* State ID = https://w3id.org/xapi/scorm/attempt-state

*Data:*

* location (value of cmi.location)
* preferences (see below for preferences data type)
* credit (value of cmi.credit)
* mode (value of cmi.mode)
* suspend_data (value of cmi.suspend_data)
* total_time (value of cmi.total_time)

*Preferences Data Type (see reference above)*

* language (value of cmi.learner_preference.language)
* audio_level (value of cmi.learner_preference.audio_level)
* delivery_speed (value of cmi.learner_preference.delivery_speed)
* audio_captioning (value of cmi.learner_preference.audio_captioning)

It is strongly recommended that implementers read and understand the [Experience API SCORM Profile](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-SCORM-Profile).  Additional data model elements and behaviors identified in this profile will be implemented in a subsequent version.
