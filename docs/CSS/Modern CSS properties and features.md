## CSS Gradients

CSS gradients allow you to create smooth visual transitions between two or more specified colors. 

## CSS Animations

For a long time, the animation on the web happened with the use of either Flash or JavaScript. CSS3 brought us an alternative with the Animation Module.

## 2D/3D transforms and transitions

Transforms and transitions are the main building blocks of CSS animations. 

## Border image

The common way to alter the look of borders is to use the options available for the border-style property.

## Multi-column layout

Despite the overwhelming popularity of the Web, printed magazines still have their own glamour â€“ and a good reason for that is the carefully crafted layout, often split in multiple columns.

## Rem and viewport units

CSS units are a large family, even though most developers are mostly familiar with pixels and (perhaps) ems. 

## Pointer events

For a long time, JavaScript was the main way to add interactivity to elements other than links and buttons. Things have changed with the wider adoption of pointer events.

## SVG Filters

All the modern browsers support a feature called svg-filters that allow you to recreate most of the effects that previously required an image editor.
