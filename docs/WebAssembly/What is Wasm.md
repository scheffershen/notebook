What is Wasm
============

`WebAssembly`, often shortened to `Wasm`, is a relatively new technology that allows you to compile application code written in over 40+ languages (including Rust, C, C++, JavaScript, and Golang) and run it inside sandboxed environments.

The original use cases were focused on running native code in web browsers, such as `Figma`, `AutoCAD`, and `Photoshop`.

Disney built their `Disney+ Application Development Kit` on top of `Wasm`! 

`WebAssembly System Interface` (`WASI`).

`Vercel`, `Fastly`, `Shopify`, and `Cloudflare` support using `Wasm` for running code at the edge

`Fermyon` is building a platform to run `Wasm` microservices in the cloud.
