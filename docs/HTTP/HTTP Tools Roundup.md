HTTP Tools Roundup
===

The starter set of tools looked like this:

## cURL

is the swiss-army command-line knife for all HTTP requests, and much, much more. It's kind of arcane but powerful and it's my tool of choice.

## jq

is a brilliant command-line tool for handling JSON; I use it with curl and this talk was about CouchDB which speaks JSON for its data format so I had to mention it here!

## http-console

is a cross-platform interactive HTTP prompt, I like it and use it a lot with CouchDB particularly.

## HTTPie

is more like curl but humane and with gorgeous colourful output that makes everything easier to read! This should be my favourite but I have the muscle memory for curl.

## Postman

is a cross-platform friendly graphical interface for making and inspecting HTTP requests. I usually recommend this to anyone who find this a more approachable way to use a computer than from the commandline. It's a very, very good tool and works on all platforms.
