## Milvus

Everything as a vector. Thatâ€™s the future that we see for neural search. 

`MilvusDocumentStore` in Haystack: Milvus encapsulates multiple `Approximate Nearest Neighbours` (ANN) libraries such as `FAISS` and `ANNOY` but is also built with the robustness and reliability required in production systems. It allows for dynamic data management

A `MilvusDocumentStore` is the perfect complement to a `DPRRetriever` or an `EmbeddingRetriever` and in our experimental runs,

## Knowledge Graph QA

## Pipeline Configs

Rather than writing lines of code to tweak Pipelines, everything that configures a Pipeline can be written in a YAML file allowing for easier and quicker experimentation cycles and also simpler maintenance of production systems.
