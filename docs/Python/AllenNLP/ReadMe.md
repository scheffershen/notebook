## About

AllenNLP is a complete platform for solving natural language processing tasks in PyTorch. We provide a broad collection of existing model implementations that are well documented and engineered to a high standard, making them a great foundation for further research.

AllenNLP offers a high-level configuration language to implement many common approaches in NLP, such as transformer experiments, multi-task training, vision+language tasks, fairness, and interpretability. This allows experimentation on a broad range of tasks purely through configuration, so you can focus on the important questions in your research.

## What is AllenNLP

- a library with well-thought-out abstractions encapsulating the common data and model operations that are done in NLP research
- a commandline tool for training PyTorch models
- a collection of pre-trained models that you can use to make predictions
- a collection of readable reference implementations of common / recent NLP models
- an experiment framework for doing replicable science
- a way to demo your research
- open source and community driven
