## Material Kit React

The kit also contains a number of basic elements such as buttons, badges, sliders, menu, pagination, navigation bars, tabs and pills.

The JavaScript elements include Modals, tooltips, date-time picker, carousels and popovers. 

The Material Kit React Pro version contains a lot more components, sections and example pages.

## VechaiUI

The library itself includes components for forms, data display, navigation, media, icons, notifications, and lots more.

The components are accessible and built using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS (a nice bonus for existing Tailwind developers). 

## Ant Design for React

Ant Design uses Less.js for its style language. The Ant Design components include buttons, icons, grids, breadcrumb, dropdown menus, pagination, and more.

## Storybook

It isn’t exactly a component library itself but is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React and many other technologies and platforms. 

## React Admin

This React UI component framework is suitable for building business-to-business (B2B) admin applications on top of REST/GraphQL APIs and is customizable by design.

In addition to the free version and its components, there’s also an enterprise solution.

## Shards React

The Shards Pro package has 15 pre-made pages that help you get started.
