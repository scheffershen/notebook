how to integrate OpenAI in your symfony project
================================================

Integrating OpenAI into a Symfony project involves a few steps:

1. Install the OpenAI API client library: You can use Composer, Symfony's package manager, to install the OpenAI API client library. Open a terminal window, navigate to your Symfony project directory and run the following command:

   ```
   composer require openai/openai-api-bundle
   ```

2. Configure the API key: You'll need an API key from OpenAI to access the API. If you don't have one, sign up for an account and create an API key. Then, add the API key to your Symfony project's environment variables.

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. Create a service for the OpenAI API client: To make API calls, you'll need to create a service for the OpenAI API client. Open your Symfony project's `services.yaml` file and add the following:

   ```
   services:
       openai.client:
           class: OpenAI\Api\Client
           arguments:
               - '%env(OPENAI_API_KEY)%'
   ```

4. Use the OpenAI API client: You can now use the OpenAI API client in your Symfony project's code. For example, to use the GPT-3 API to generate text, you can call the `completions` method of the client, like this:

   ```
   use OpenAI\Api\Client;
   
   $client = $container->get(Client::class);
   $result = $client->completions([
       'prompt' => 'Once upon a time',
       'temperature' => 0.5,
       'max_tokens' => 50,
   ]);
   
   echo $result['choices'][0]['text'];
   ```

   This will generate a short story starting with the prompt "Once upon a time".

That's it! With these steps, you can now integrate OpenAI into your Symfony project and start using its powerful AI capabilities.
