how to use OpenAI api in a python flask api server with your faqs
================================================================

2023-01

as a python flask developer how to build your question and answer api using openai api based on your own data

```python
import openai
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Define API endpoint
@app.route('/answer', methods=['POST'])
def get_answer():
    # Get question from POST request
    question = request.json['question']
    
    # Call OpenAI API to get answer
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci", 
        prompt=question, 
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    # Return answer
    return jsonify({'answer': response.choices[0].text})

```

## docker-compose

Certainly! Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to run a Python Flask API service in a Docker container:

```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
      FLASK_APP: app.py
    command: flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a single service called `web`, which runs a Python Flask application. Here's what each of the configuration options does:

- `build: .` tells Docker to build the image for the service using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).
- `ports: - "5000:5000"` maps port 5000 on the host to port 5000 in the container, so that you can access the Flask API from your web browser or another client.
- `volumes: - .:/app` mounts the current directory (`.`) on the host to the `/app` directory in the container. This is useful for development, since it allows you to make changes to your code without having to rebuild the Docker image every time.
- `environment: FLASK_ENV: development FLASK_APP: app.py` sets environment variables for the Flask application. The `FLASK_ENV` variable sets the application environment to "development", which enables debugging and hot reloading. The `FLASK_APP` variable specifies the entry point for the Flask application.
- `command: flask run --host=0.0.0.0` runs the Flask application inside the container, listening on all network interfaces (so that it can be accessed from the host).

To use this `docker-compose.yml` file, simply save it in a directory along with your Flask application code and run `docker-compose up`. This will start the container and begin running your Flask API service.
