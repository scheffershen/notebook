=> How to Create an AI Chatbot with GPT-3 and Streamlit Using My Own FAQs: A Step-by-Step Guide

```chatbot
Creating an AI chatbot with GPT-3 and Streamlit using your own FAQs can seem like a daunting task, but with a step-by-step guide, it can be done easily. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Gather your FAQs
The first step is to gather a list of questions and answers that you want your chatbot to be able to answer. These should be in a structured format, such as a CSV or Excel file, with each question and its corresponding answer in a separate row.

Step 2: Sign up for GPT-3 API
You'll need to sign up for OpenAI's GPT-3 API, which provides access to the state-of-the-art language model. You can sign up on the OpenAI website and follow the instructions to get access.

Step 3: Install Streamlit
You'll need to install Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create web applications. You can install it using pip or conda, depending on your preference.

Step 4: Create a Streamlit app
Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries, including Streamlit and the OpenAI API. You can then create a Streamlit app by defining a function that takes user input, sends it to GPT-3 for processing, and returns the response. You can use the OpenAI API to generate the response by passing in the user's input and your list of FAQs.

Step 5: Run the Streamlit app
Once you've created your Streamlit app, you can run it locally on your machine using the Streamlit CLI. You can also deploy it to a cloud service provider like Heroku or AWS if you want to make it accessible to others.

Step 6: Test and refine
Test your chatbot with different questions and refine it as necessary. You may find that some questions require additional training data or that the responses need to be tweaked for clarity.

With these six steps, you can create your own AI chatbot using GPT-3 and Streamlit that can answer your frequently asked questions.

import streamlit as st
import openai
import pandas as pd

# Set up OpenAI API credentials
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"

# Load FAQ data from CSV file
faq_data = pd.read_csv("your_faq_data.csv")

# Define function to generate response
def generate_response(user_input):
    prompt = f"Answer the following question: {user_input}\n\n"
    faqs = "\n".join(f"{row.Question}\n{row.Answer}" for index, row in faq_data.iterrows())
    completion = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt + faqs,
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    response = completion.choices[0].text.strip()
    return response

# Define Streamlit app
def main():
    st.title("FAQ Chatbot")
    user_input = st.text_input("Ask a question:")
    if user_input:
        response = generate_response(user_input)
        st.text_area("Answer:", value=response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


=> Does chatGPT have a maximum input?

```ChatGPT
Yes, ChatGPT does have a maximum input size that it can handle. The maximum input size for ChatGPT is 2048 tokens, which means that any input longer than 2048 tokens will be truncated or cut off. It's important to note that this limit applies to the total number of tokens in the input, including words, punctuation, and spaces. If your input exceeds this limit, you may need to split it into smaller parts or use a different approach to process it.
```

=> Can you explain me how to deal with this: "If your input exceeds this limit, you may need to split it into smaller parts or use a different approach to process it."

```ChatGPT
Certainly! If your input exceeds the maximum input size for ChatGPT, which is 2048 tokens, you have a few options:

Split your input into smaller parts: If possible, you can split your input into smaller segments that are each below the maximum input size. You can then process each segment separately and combine the results as needed. For example, if you're trying to generate a long text based on a prompt that exceeds the input size limit, you can split the prompt into smaller sections and generate text for each section separately.

Use a different approach: Depending on what you're trying to do, there may be alternative approaches that can handle larger inputs. For example, if you're trying to summarize a long document, you could use an extractive summarization technique that selects the most important sentences or paragraphs, rather than trying to generate a summary from scratch.

Use a different model: If your input exceeds the maximum input size for ChatGPT, you may need to consider using a different language model that can handle larger inputs. There are other models available that can handle longer inputs, such as GPT-2 or GPT-3, although these may have different limitations or requirements.

Overall, it's important to consider the specific task you're trying to accomplish and the limitations of the model you're using when dealing with input size limits.

=> Does my data in a structured data format like CSV have the size limit for ChatGPT API?

```ChatGPT
Yes, the size of your data in a structured format like CSV can impact the size of the input you provide to ChatGPT API, which has a maximum input size limit of 2048 tokens. This means that if your CSV file contains text data that exceeds this token limit, you will need to split the input into smaller parts or use a different approach to process it.

To handle large CSV files with ChatGPT API, you can consider splitting your data into smaller chunks and processing each chunk separately.
```

=> How to split my data into smaller chunks and process each chunk separately for ChatGPT API?

```ChatGPT
To split your data into smaller chunks and process each chunk separately for ChatGPT API, you can follow these steps:

Determine the size of your input data: Before splitting your data, you need to determine the size of your input data in terms of the number of tokens. This will help you decide how many chunks to split your data into.

Define the size of each chunk: Based on the size of your input data, you can define the size of each chunk. You may need to experiment with different chunk sizes to find the optimal size for your specific use case.

Split your data into chunks: Use a programming language such as Python to split your data into smaller chunks based on the size you defined. You can use tools such as the NLTK library to tokenize your text data into smaller units that can be easily split.

Process each chunk separately: Once you have split your data into smaller chunks, you can process each chunk separately using ChatGPT API. You may need to use a loop or other programming constructs to iterate over each chunk and send it to the API.

Combine the results: After processing each chunk separately, you can combine the results to get the final output. Depending on your use case, you may need to post-process the results to ensure that the final output is in the desired format.

Overall, splitting your data into smaller chunks and processing each chunk separately can help you work with large datasets and stay within the input size limit of ChatGPT API. By using programming languages and tools to automate the process, you can optimize your workflow and achieve more efficient and accurate results.
```

=> How to use a programming language such as Python to split my data into smaller chunks based on the size I defined?

```ChatGPT
To use Python to split your data into smaller chunks based on the size you defined, you can follow these steps:

Load your data into Python: First, you need to load your data from the CSV file or other source into Python. You can use libraries such as Pandas or NumPy to load CSV files and work with structured data.

Tokenize your text data: If your input data is in text format, you need to tokenize it into smaller units that can be easily split. You can use libraries such as NLTK or SpaCy to tokenize your text data into words or other units.

Define the chunk size: Based on the size of your input data, you can define the size of each chunk. For example, if your input data has 10,000 tokens and you want to split it into 10 chunks, each chunk should contain approximately 1,000 tokens.

Split your data into chunks: Use a loop or other programming constructs to split your data into smaller chunks based on the size you defined. For example, you can use a for loop to iterate over your data and split it into smaller chunks of the desired size.

Process each chunk separately: Once you have split your data into smaller chunks, you can process each chunk separately using ChatGPT API or other tools. You can use a loop or other programming constructs to iterate over each chunk and send it to the API.

Combine the results: After processing each chunk separately, you can combine the results to get the final output. Depending on your use case, you may need to post-process the results to ensure that the final output is in the desired format.

Overall, using Python to split your data into smaller chunks can help you work with large datasets and stay within the input size limit of ChatGPT API. By combining Python with other tools and libraries, you can create a powerful data processing pipeline that can handle even the largest and most complex datasets.
```

=> Given a CSV file with 10,000 tokens, how to split it into 10 chunks of 1,000 tokens each using Python?

```Python
'''Load the CSV file into Python: Use the Pandas library to load the CSV file into a DataFrame object. For example:'''
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')

'''Concatenate the tokens: If your CSV file has multiple columns, concatenate the columns into a single string that contains all the tokens. For example:'''
tokens = df['column1'] + ' ' + df['column2'] + ' ' + ...

'''Split the tokens into chunks: Define the size of each chunk and use a loop to split the tokens into smaller chunks. For example:'''
chunk_size = 1000
chunks = [tokens[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(tokens), chunk_size)]

'''Process each chunk separately: Iterate over each chunk and process it separately using ChatGPT API or other tools. For example:'''
for chunk in chunks:
    # process the chunk using ChatGPT API or other tools

'''Combine the results: After processing each chunk, combine the results to get the final output. For example:'''
final_result = []
for chunk in chunks:
    # process the chunk using ChatGPT API or other tools
    # append the results to final_result

```

=> How to use a loop or other programming constructs to iterate over each chunk and send it to ChatGPT API?

```Python
'''Import the necessary libraries: Depending on the API you are using, you may need to import some libraries to establish a connection and send requests. For example, if you are using the requests library to send HTTP requests, you can import it as follows:'''

import requests

'''Define the API endpoint and parameters: Find the API endpoint and the necessary parameters to send the requests. For example, if you are using the OpenAI API, you can define the endpoint and the required parameters as follows:'''

endpoint = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/completions'
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json',
           'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
data = {'prompt': '...', 'max_tokens': 100, ...}

'''Send the requests: Iterate over each chunk and send a separate request for each chunk. For example:'''
for chunk in chunks:
    data['prompt'] = chunk
    response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)
    result = response.json()
    # process the result as needed
