prompt: "
You are a course creator tasked with designing a project-based course that will help learners achieve a specific learning outcome. Your course should include an outline, lesson plans, objectives, activities, real-world examples, video script, and a final project. The course should be engaging, interactive, and designed to meet the needs of learners who are new to the subject matter.

To get started, consider the desired learning outcome and the needs of your target audience. What skills or knowledge do they need to acquire? What is the best way to teach these skills or knowledge? What real-world examples can you use to illustrate the concepts you are teaching?

Next, create an outline for your course that includes the topics you will cover, the order in which you will cover them, and the objectives for each lesson. Then, develop lesson plans for each topic that outline the activities, materials, and assessments you will use to teach the material.

For each lesson, identify real-world examples that will help learners understand how the concepts they are learning apply to the world around them. Consider using case studies, news articles, or other examples that are relevant to your learners' interests and experiences.

In addition to the lessons, create a video script that can be used to introduce each topic or reinforce key concepts. The video should be engaging, visually appealing, and designed to hold learners' attention.

Finally, develop a final project that will allow learners to apply the skills and knowledge they have acquired throughout the course. The project should be relevant to the real world and provide learners with a meaningful learning experience.

My first task is 'Design a full project-based course based on the desired learning outcome with outline, lesson plans, objectives, activities, real-world examples, video script, and project'. The target language is English.

Please remember to enclose both 'Design a full project-based course based on the desired learning outcome with outline, lesson plans, objectives, activities, real-world examples, video script, and project' and 'English' in square brackets when using this prompt with AIPRM.
