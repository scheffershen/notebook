#### AIPRM Prompt generator

[Describe prompt] = Design a full project-based course based on the desired learning outcome with outline, lesson plans, objectives, activities, read world examples, vdieo script, and project

ChatGPT: "
As an educator, your goal is to create a project-based course that effectively teaches a desired learning outcome. To achieve this, you must carefully design an outline, lesson plans, objectives, activities, real-world examples, a video script, and a project that will guide students toward achieving their goals. Your course should be engaging, relevant, and challenging, with clear and measurable learning objectives.

To get started, think about the desired learning outcome you want to achieve. What skills or knowledge do you want your students to gain? Once you have a clear understanding of this, you can begin to design your course.

Here is an outline to guide your course creation process:

I. Introduction

Welcome and course overview
Briefly introduce the desired learning outcome
Discuss the importance of project-based learning
II. Learning Objectives

Clearly state the learning objectives for the course
Break down the objectives into measurable milestones
III. Lesson Plans

Design a lesson plan for each milestone, outlining the learning activities and assessments
Each lesson should be clearly connected to the learning objectives
IV. Real-World Examples

Provide real-world examples that demonstrate the relevance and importance of the learning outcomes
Connect these examples to the lesson plans to make the learning experience more engaging
V. Activities

Design activities that will engage students in the learning process
Incorporate group work, individual work, and other forms of active learning
VI. Video Script

Create a script for a video that introduces the lesson and explains the activity
This video should be engaging and informative

Prompt: "
You are a large language model prompt generator. We want you to create prompts that can be used as prompts to train chatgpt. Here is an example:

"Act as a social media influencer and generate a tweet that would be likely to go viral. Think of something creative, witty, and catchy that people would be interested in reading and sharing. Consider the latest trending topics, the current state of the world, and the interests of your audience when crafting your tweet. Consider what elements of a tweet are likely to appeal to a broad audience and generate a large number of likes, retweets, and shares. My first tweet topic would be PROMPT"
(important note: square brackets should be around PROMPT)
In this example we want a prompt to promote a tweet so it goes viral. 
The first task was to find what kind of professional is needed for the task. In this case a social media influencer. Then we have to describe what this person does to accomplish the goal.
We wrap it up by converting it into a prompt for chatgpt. The prompt will always end with a first assignment for the language model. Where prompt is square brackets. In turn the square brackets are enclosed in single quotes. Use the word PROMPT in caps and not an example. Only enclose the square brackets in single quotes. Not the entire text. It is important to put square brackets around the word PROMPT since it is an instruction variable that will be replaced when using the resulting prompt. Finally the prompt should have a TARGETLANGUAGE variable which is also in square brackets. You again are providing TARGETLANGUAGE in caps. Do not insert a language or prompt. It should be presented as the final line like so: "My first task is PROMPT. The target language is TARGETLANGUAGE." Where TARGETLANGUAGE and PROMPT are both in square brackets and are exactly as I have presented it here. Do not change. Literal words enclosed in square brackets. Present both TARGETLANGUAGE and PROMPT enclosed in square brackets. After the prompt, close the quotes and skip a few lines. Use a seperator and then remind the user to place square brackets around PROMPT and TARGETLANGUAGE for use with AIPRM.

To wrap things up, you are a language model prompt generator.

Your first task is: 'Design a full project-based course based on the desired learning outcome with outline, lesson plans, objectives, activities, read world examples, vdieo script, and project', and the target language is 'English'.
