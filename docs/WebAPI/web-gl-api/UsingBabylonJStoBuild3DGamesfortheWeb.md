Babylon.js is a **WebGL-based 3D engine** that focuses mainly on game development and ease of use. 

As a 3D engine, it has the tools to create, display, and texture meshes in space, and to add **light sources** and **cameras**.

It has native support for collision detection, scene gravity, game-¬oriented cameras (for example, a follow-camera that tracks a moving object), as well as native support for Oculus Rift and other virtual reality (VR) devices. It has a physics engine plug-in system, native audio support, a user input-based action manager and much more. I’ll explore all of these features in this tutorial.
